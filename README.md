# cortex_tracking
Functions to process files from the Cortex movement tracking system.

## To do

- Cortex file example.
- Read file and map names to a data structure.
- Add filtering, smoothing and interpolation.
- Logic to deal with signals. Everything can be calculated on a signal.
- Read information for the links and joints (mark's protocol).
      -  Joint: Ankle
      -  Marks: M1, M2, M3
      -  Names of segments: Forearm, arm
- Calculate joint angles.
- Draw animation of movement.
- Detect or suggest start and ending events.
- Mass matrix calculation of center of mass.
- Inertia tensors and torques.
- Time normalization.
- Statistics calculations.

- UCM calculation.
- For 2D.
- For 3D.
- Decide ways to define performance variable.
